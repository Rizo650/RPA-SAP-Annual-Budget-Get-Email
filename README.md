# SAP Annual Budget - Get Email (UiPath RPA)

This RPA project automates the retrieval of **Annual Budget emails** from different departments in real-time, classifies them into 3 types (**HO, BU, SU**), and saves the attachments into a shared folder for further processing.  

This is the first part of the **SAP Annual Budget Automation**, followed by the Compile process.
